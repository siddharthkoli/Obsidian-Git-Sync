In a distributed computer system, you can only support two of the following guarantees:

- **Consistency** - Every read receives the most recent write or an error
- **Availability** - Every request receives a response, without guarantee that it contains the most recent version of the information
- **Partition Tolerance** - The system continues to operate despite arbitrary partitioning due to network failures
