A system is scalable if the performance of the system increases in proportion to new resources added.
A system has high performance if it can process a large number of work units and/or process large work units faster.

 - If you have a performance problem, the system is slow for a single user.
 - If you have a scalability problem, the system is fast for a single user, but slow under heavy load (large no. of users.)
