It is the processes of reducing the redundancy of data in the table and also improving the data integrity. So why is this required? without Normalization in SQL, we may face many issues such as:

1.  _**Insertion anomaly**_: It occurs when we cannot insert data to the table without the presence of another attribute
2.  _**Update anomaly**_:  It is a data inconsistency that results from data redundancy and a partial update of data.
3.  _**Deletion Anomaly**_: It occurs when certain attributes are lost because of the deletion of other attributes.
