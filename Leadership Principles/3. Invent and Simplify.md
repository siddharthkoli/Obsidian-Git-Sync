### Questions on "Invent and Simplify":

-   Describe a time when you found a simple solution to a complex problem. 
-   Tell me about a time when you invented something.
-   Tell me about a time when you tried to simplify a process but failed. What would you have done differently?

S : Situation, T : Task, A: Action, R: Results

-   S :  During the development of my queues project which involved doctors, I faced an issue where the customers of the app had no way to identify whether the doctor that they were interacting with was genuine. 
    
-   T :  I needed some way to remove scam doctors from the application.
    
-   A :  The naive approach was to ask all the doctors to submit a copy of their registration certificate to us. But this method failed because doctors were not complying with us since they practically had nothing to lose if they didn't comply. So the simple solution was to flip the problem on its head. We created a verification system where doctors had to submit their copy of registration to get a verified status. 
    
-   R :  Due to the natural tendency of humans to favour verified sources, doctors would be subtly enforced into submitting it since not complying would result in their loss only.
