JVM, JRE, and JDK are platform dependent because the configuration of each [OS](https://www.javatpoint.com/os-tutorial) is different from each other. However, Java is platform independent.

JVM - Java Virtual Machine

JVM (Java Virtual Machine) is an abstract machine. It is called a virtual machine because it doesn't physically exist. It is a specification that provides a runtime environment in which Java bytecode can be executed. It can also run those programs which are written in other languages and compiled to Java bytecode.
The JVM performs the following main tasks:

-   Loads code
-   Verifies code
-   Executes code
-   Provides runtime environment

JRE - Java Runtime Environment
The Java Runtime Environment is a set of software tools which are used for developing Java applications. It is used to provide the runtime environment. It is the implementation of JVM. It physically exists. It contains a set of libraries + other files that JVM uses at runtime.
