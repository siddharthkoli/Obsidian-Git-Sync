#subarray, #kadane
	
Before jumping to the full solution, let's take a step back and consider simpler versions of this problem: 

-   If the array only consisted of positive integers, the solution would be trivial: product of the entire array. We can implement this by calculating a _running_ product like so:
``` cpp
int runningProd = 1;
for (auto x: nums)
	runningProd *= x;
return runningProd;
```

- If we add zeroes to the mix, now we have to get a bit smarter. As we loop over the array, if the current number `n` is zero, then `runningProduct` would be zero and be stuck there. So, we need to reset it. Intuitively, whenever `runningProduct` is less than the current number `n`, we start considering a new sub-array that starts from the current number. Since `runningProduct` will be reset, we will also need a variable to hold the max `runningProduct` that we have encountered.

``` cpp
int best = INT_MIN;
int runningProd = 1;
for (auto x: nums) {
	// Pick the larger of current number and the result of the multiplication
    // Picking n means we start considering a new sub-array
    runningProduct = max(runningProduct * n, n);
    // Keep track of the max runningProduct that we find
    best = max(runningProduct, best);
}
return best;
```

-   Above, we only cared about the maximum value we can achieve and started a new sub-array using `max` whenever we encountered a zero. Finally, let's also consider negative numbers to find the general solution to the given problem. Consider the array `1, -2, -3, 4`. When we are at the second element, our runningProduct becomes `-2`. But at the third element it becomes `6`. So, as we encounter negative numbers they change the sign of our product. Our product can become really small but then really big depending on the sign of the current number. To accomodate for this, we can have two running products: `maxProd` and `minProd`. `maxProd` will track the maximum product that we can achieve and will reset whenever the current number is greater, just as above. `minProd`, on the other hand, will track the minimum product that we can achieve and will reset whenever the current number is smaller. Finally, whenever we encounter a negative number, we will swap `maxProd` and `minProd` because if `a <= b` then `-b <= -a`. This makes sure that `maxProd` and `minProd` are still the max and min products after multiplied by a negative number. And, with that, we have the following solution:

``` cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int maxProduct(vector<int>& nums) {
        // Return early if input is empty
        if (nums.empty()) return 0;
		
        int best = INT_MIN;
        // Running products
        int maxProd = 1;
        int minProd = 1;
        
        for (int n: nums) {
            if (n < 0) {
                // Swap max and min
                swap(maxProd, minProd);
            }
            // Reset to current value if smaller or larger than it
            // (intuitively means that we start considering a new sub-array)
            maxProd = max(maxProd*n, n);
            minProd = min(minProd*n, n);
            // Update the best
            best = max(best, maxProd);
        }
        
        return best;
    }
};
```
